Vim Repo

## I'm moving entirely over to Neovim so I'll be archiving this repo. Check out https://github.com/kyokley/nvimRepo.

These are my vim settings and install script. Everything is kind of just thrown together for now. One day when I get more time, I will organize everything and make it pretty. Today is not that day.
