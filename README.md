Vim Repo

These are my vim settings and install script. Everything is kind of just thrown together for now. One day when I get more time, I will organize everything and make it pretty. Today is not that day.

## Points of interest
### VIM PSQL Pager

I always liked how using less as a pager gives you the ability to do fancy things like scroll up, down, left, and right. However, I always wished I could freeze the column headers at the top of the screen when using it with psql. The vimpsqlpager script addresses that problem.

I tried making a script to work with pgcli but it's still a little buggy. Use at your own risk.
